# FastAPI-example

Simple example of how a FastAPI application can be structured. See the
[FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for details on how FastAPI works.

## Running the example app

Install requirements and execute the run script:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ ./run.sh
